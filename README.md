Dear adm.picovico.com, 
I don't know how fate decided and brought us together. But once it decided, it must have set that you will leave this world from my hands only. We have been very good friends though it took us quite a long time to understand each other. Eventhough you failed to answer very important questions to be answered during your lifetime, you remained in the state of being calm and humble. I must say you honored our friendship.

But friend, you got older day by day, and I couldn't make myself see any longer that you are dying everyday. So I must say, without any sorrow and grief, I took you down from this world. 

You must have reached the Purgatory and you will soon rejoice the serenity of heaven. However, If you have to be resurrected, yes I will bring you down. And yes, I will be honored.

Yours,
acpmasquerade
